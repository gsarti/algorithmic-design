# Homeworks

All the following homeworks are compulsory in order to take the course exam:

1) Optimize the code inside the `code/02_matrix_multiplication` folder to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and computations.

2) Implement the chain matrix multiplication algorithm presented in `03_chain_matrix_multiplication.pdf` iteratively (see pseudocode at the end of slides).
