# Homework 2: Chain Matrix Multiplication

* Implement the iterative dynamic-programming algorithm to solve the chain matrix multiplication problem.

* Test the implementations on a set of instances of the problem and evaluate the execution time.

## Disclaimer

The code for this assignment was given to us by Prof. Casagrande, and since my version of the algorithm wasn't working I simply took the given implementation. My disfunctional code for this task can be found in old commits into this repository.
