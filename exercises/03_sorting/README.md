# Homework 3: Sorting

* Implement Insertion Sort and Quick Sort.
  
* Implement Heap Sort by using binary heap implementation required by the homework on heaps.
  
* Implement Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort.

* Implement the Select Algorithm.

* Test the implementations on a set of instances of the problem and evaluate their execution times.

* Prove by testing that both Insertion Sort and Quick Sort take time `O(n^2)` in the worst case.

* Prove by testing that Insertion Sort and Quick Sort take in the best case time `O(n)` and `O(n log n)` respectively.

* Why did we assume that there were no repeated values in A? Generalize the implementation of the Select Algorithm to also deal with repeated values.
