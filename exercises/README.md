# Homeworks

The numbered folders contain the five mandatory homeworks for the course of Algorithmic Design.

In order to test the code for each assignment, simply execute `make all` or look at `Makefile` to compile specific executables. The explanation of each executable output is contained inside the `README` of the respective folder.

Files `utility.h` and `utility.h` are used in the first four homeworks in order to provide basic functions and avoid code duplication.
